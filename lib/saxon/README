About the saxon directory
=========================

The Saxon XSLT processor of Michael Kay is distributed under a license that you
can find in the COPYING file.  Using this software implies you are bound by
this license.

For you convenience, we bundle Saxon with Krextor.  Every once a while, we update
to the latest version.

Version 9.1 (in saxon9.jar) is the last open source version that supported Java
extension functions, which the Java output module uses.

For more details about Saxon and obtaining the latest version, please see:

* http://www.saxonica.com (commercial, schema-aware version)
* http://saxon.sourceforge.net/ (open-source version without schema support;
  the one used here)

Any trouble with the runnable capabilities of _this_ installation should be
reported on the Krextor Trac at http://trac.kwarc.info/krextor/, not to the
Saxon developers.
