About the xsltdoc directory
===========================

The XSLTdoc tool is distributed under a license that you can find in the
COPYING file.  Using this software implies you are bound by this license.

For you convenience, we bundle XSLTdoc with Krextor.  Every once a while, we
update to the latest version.

For more details about XSLTdoc and obtaining the latest version, please see http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc/ .

Any trouble with the runnable capabilities of _this_ installation should be
reported on the Krextor Trac at https://trac.kwarc.info/krextor/, not to the
XSLTdoc developers.
